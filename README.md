# Penny Software QA Test
### Task Goal:
Build an end-to-end testing framework for a web app which validates the expected results/scenarios and imitates real user behavior
### Technology: 
    -JavaScript
    -TestCafe
    -Chrome
### Requriments:
Create an end-to-end testing procedure that mimics real user activity of a web application/site of your choice that does the following: signup, sign in and sign out of a given web app. In addition, the test procedure should validate users account creation and have them registered as new users. The test framework should identify all possible scenarios where the app can fail. For example, signing in with unregistered users or signing in with wrong credentials. Push your project code to GitHub and submit a recording demonstrating the test functionality as well as code walkthrough.
### Boounty Points:
    * Document all intended test cases as appropriate.
    * Implement cross-browser end-to-end testing.
    * Implement mobile-friendly end-to-end testing.
    * Explain how you can integrate the test framework as part of GCP deployment cycle.
